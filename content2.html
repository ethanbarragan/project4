				<h3>Iron Patriot is a painted version of the War Machine Armor Mark II. The suit of armor has a unique color scheme and a more advanced design compared to its predecessors. The color scheme of red, blue, and white and a slim aerodynamic and versatile body armor is superior than previous models. In response to "The Mandarin's Lessons", the armor was rebranded by Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M), who gave it a "patriotic" appearance. The armor layout has red, blue and silver platings overall. The design takes on the appearance of the U.S. National Flag, and it has a star shaped outline around the armor's Unibeam. The Unibeam of the Iron Patriot is a vertical rectangular shaped one, and has a light red glow emitting from it, as well as with the helmet's eyes section of the armor. Armour features include a sliding gun. The armor has a powerful weapon equipped to its back. It is one of the main offensive and defensive features of the armor which makes the it a versatile and lethal weapon.</h3>
