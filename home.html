				<h2>Tony Stark, a middle-aged billionaire industrialist from the United States, was severely wounded during an enemy attack where he was captured and forced to build a weapon of mass destruction for his capturers. Instead, he created an advanced suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Now with a new outlook on life, Tony uses his money, his intelligence, and his companyâ€™s resources to make the world a peaceful place as Iron Man. Iron Man possesses no natural powers but has sophisticated and advanced weaponry built into the armor suit. Iron Man is affiliated with the following organization: The Avengers, Initiative, Hellfire Club (outer circle), S.H.I.E.L.D., Illuminati, Thunderbolts, Force Works, Queen's Vengeance, Alcoholics Anonymous.</h2>
