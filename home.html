					<h2>Tony Stark, a middle-aged billionaire industrialist from the United States was severely wounded during an enemy missile attack where he was captured and forced to build a weapon of mass destruction for his capturers. Instead, he created an advanced suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Now with a new outlook on life, Tony uses his money, his intelligence, and his companyâ€™s resources to make the world a peaceful place under the watch eye of Iron Man. Iron Man possesses no natural powers or abilities. He is a sophisticated and advanced suit of armor with a host of weaponry. Iron Man is affiliated with the following organizations: The Avengers, Initiative, Hellfire Club (outer circle), S.H.I.E.L.D., Illuminati, Thunderbolts, Force Works, Queen's Vengeance, and Alcoholics Anonymous.</h2>
